# Machine Learning Dashboard using Streamlit ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ
The codebase contains a code of building a simple ML model using 'scikit-learn' and a dashboard using 'Streamlit.' The dashboard enables you to tweak hyperparameters and predict a class with your built model.

The app is deployed on the streamlit community. Link to the [app](https://docker-app-sklearn-app-z364ymjlrp3mfvzozitnsx.streamlit.app/prediction)
